Team-based urban planning themed card game with individual player turns. Currently has basic working structure and functionality. To-do:

Complete game contents:

-Create rest of cards from dextrous template.
-Come up with ~10 new cards.
-Set card frequencies based on their power.

Initial testing:

-Test for reasonable balance between teams (assuming even number of players).

-Test repeated uses of indiviudal cards and adjust card effects or frequencies to balance.

-Test various win conditions, determine expected game length / number of turns.

-Test cards with challange components or interactive effects more rigorously.

-Test cards with threshholds that determine their scoring  more rigorously.


Further testing:

-Hypothesize what some imbalances could be and run a simulation with imposed bias in favour of certain cards (dependant on team) to test imbalances further (try to find easy or guaranteed wins for either side and engineer this out of the game).

-Train an AI model to play to reveal further hidden imbalances.
